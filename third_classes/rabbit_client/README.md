# RabbitClient

Run me with `iex -S mix`.

## Exercise

Implement a client (processes receiving messages in the recursive loop).
Each client will know `the word for the day` and will be given a a request with a word that needs to be checked and replies with a list of colored letters (like we did coloring in the previous one of the previous tasks).
