# RabbitMQ 101

## Start Rabbit MQ using docker

Start RabbitMQ in docker container in a separate terminal: `docker-compose up`.

In a second terminal, connect to the container:

```bash
docker exec -it third_classes_rabbitmq_1 /bin/bash
```

and add the test user:

```bash
rabbitmqctl add_user test test
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags test administrator
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / test ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

Then dicosnnect form the rabbit container using Ctrl+d.

## Install AMQP dependency

```elixir
Mix.install([{:amqp, "~> 3.1"}])
```

Starting all of the needed applications.

```elixir
Application.ensure_all_started(:amqp)
```

## Publishing a message

A `producer` is a user application that *sends* messages.
A `queue` is a buffer that *stores* messages.
A `consumer` is a user application that *receives* messages.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
  graph LR;
      p([Producer]) -- message --> e{exchange};
      e{exchange} -- message --> q[queue my_test_channel];
```

```elixir
## In case you break a channel change it's name and try running the code again.
queue_name = "my_test_channel"
msg = "Hello World!!XD"

options = [
  ## Depending on your OS you might need to adjsust the host.
  ## I am using MacOS therefore I have "host.docker.internal" here
  host: "host.docker.internal",
  port: 5672,
  username: "test",
  password: "test"
]

## The first thing we need to do is to establish a connection with RabbitMQ server.
{:ok, connection} = AMQP.Connection.open(options)
{:ok, channel} = AMQP.Channel.open(connection)

## Next, before sending we need to make sure the recipient queue exists.
## If we send a message to non-existing location, RabbitMQ will just trash the message.
## Let's create a queue to which the message will be delivered, let's name it #{queue_name}
case AMQP.Queue.declare(channel, queue_name) do
  :ok -> :ok
  {:ok, info} -> info
end
```

In RabbitMQ a message can never be sent directly to the queue,
it always needs to go through an exchange. 
A default exchange identified by an empty string (`""`).
This exchange is special - it allows us to specify exactly to which queue the message should go.
The queue name needs to be specified in the `routing_key` parameter.

```elixir
:ok = AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, "", queue_name, msg)
IO.puts(" [x] Sent #{msg}")
```

## Consuming "Hello World!"

```mermaid
  graph LR;
  q[queue my_test_channel]-- message -->c([Consumer]);
```

Our consumer listens for messages from RabbitMQ,
so unlike the producer which publishes a single message,
we'll keep the consumer running to listen for messages and print them out or timeout.

```elixir
{:ok, connection} = AMQP.Connection.open(options)
{:ok, channel} = AMQP.Channel.open(connection)

## Just like before, we need to make sure that the queue exists.
## Creating a queue using `AMQP.Queue.declare`` is idempotent.
## We can run the command as many times as we like, and only one will be created.
case AMQP.Queue.declare(channel, queue_name) do
  :ok -> :ok
  {:ok, info} -> info
end

{:ok, _} = AMQP.Basic.consume(channel, queue_name, nil, no_ack: true)

receive do
  {:basic_deliver, payload, _meta} ->
    IO.puts(" [x] Received #{payload}")
after
  5000 -> :timeout
end
```

```elixir
## Clean up not to receive messages to this consumer
:ok = AMQP.Channel.close(channel)
:ok = AMQP.Connection.close(connection)
```

## The reciver in a console

Open a terminal window and run a receirer in an Elixir shell.

```
cd rabbit_client/
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```

I have set up an Elixir project for your conviniece, installing a amqp client and starting it for you.

Now call `Receive.wait_for_messages("my_test_channel", 3)` in the shell and press enter.
The shell will hang waiting for the messages.

Now go back to this livebook and publish 3 messages (unsing the Elixir section below).

Nexts start another shell in the rabbit_client directory
(so you have one on left side of the screen and one on right hand side),
and in both shells wait for 1 message:
`Receive.wait_for_messages("my_test_channel", 1)`.
Next send 3 messages (again using the Elixir section below).

Hint: If you need to exit the shell at any point press Ctrl+c twice.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
  graph LR;
  q[queue my_test_channel]-- message 1 -->c1([Consumer shell 1]);
  q[queue my_test_channel]-- message 2 -->c2([Consumer shell 2]);
  q[queue my_test_channel]-- message 3 -->c3([Livebook]);
```

```elixir
{:ok, connection} = AMQP.Connection.open(options)
{:ok, channel} = AMQP.Channel.open(connection)

:ok = AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, "", queue_name, "First msg")
:ok = AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, "", queue_name, "Second msg")
:ok = AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, "", queue_name, "Third msg")
```

## Exchanges

The core idea in the messaging model in RabbitMQ is that the producer never sends any messages directly to a queue.
Actually, quite often the producer doesn't even know if a message will be delivered to any queue at all.
Instead, the producer can only send messages to an exchange.
An exchange is a very simple thing.
On one side it receives messages from producers and the other side it pushes them to queues.
The exchange must know exactly what to do with a message it receives.
The rules for that are defined by the **exchange type**.
There are a few exchange types available:

* direct - a message goes to the queues whose binding key exactly matches the routing key of the message
* topic - a message goes to the queues whose where binding key must also be in the same form
* headers - use the message header attributes to send a messages to queue instead of routing key
* fanout - it just broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows

```mermaid
  graph LR;
  p(daily word producer) --> e{word_of_the_day exchange};
  e{word_of_the_day exchange} --> q1[words checker 1];
  e{word_of_the_day exchange} --> q2[words checker 2];
  e{word_of_the_day exchange} --> q3[words checker 3];
```

```elixir
AMQP.Exchange.declare(channel, "word_of_the_day", :fanout)
```

```elixir
message = "Word of the day is `candy`"
AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, "word_of_the_day", "", message)
```

```elixir
message = "Word of the day is `chess`"
AMQP.Basic.publish(channel, "word_of_the_day", "", message)
```
